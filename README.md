# CodeGuess
Code Guess is a logic puzzle game where players must uncover a hidden numerical code. Choose between 3, 4, 5 or 6 number modes, and select your difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard, each offering different amounts of attempts. Each round generates a random code with unique numbers. After every guess, feedback helps you find the correct code using logic and deduction.
